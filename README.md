#CSS Training

Although CSS syntax may be quite simple and easy to catch, it may get a lot of practice to achieve decent UI when built from scratch.

This repo offers 3 challanges for you to style:

 - A basic form, which contents are related to a videogame account creation
 - A simple text, extracted from: https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3280677 
 - A minimalistic landing page, where you gotta match the pattern on the image

 Challange solutions will be on 'results' branch, try not to check it unless you are geniunely stuck

 Happy styling!
